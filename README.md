Skyrim AE Wabbajack Modlist

Welcome to our Skyrim Modlist!
We are working to create a comprehensive overhaul that brings realism and immersion to your Skyrim playthrough. 

Installation:
1. Install Wabbajack
2. Pick this modlist (NSFW Category)
3. Choose location
4. Allow install to complete

Launching Game:
1. Select a profile to use (There are 3 included profiles with different ENB settings for performance)
2. Make sure the overwrite section of MO2 is empty
3. In the executable section make sure "Skyrim AE (SKSE)" is selected, hit run. ***NOTE*** The first time you run the game, it may appear to CTD (This is because the KiLoader and ENB files need to generate.) After this CTD, rerun the game it should start now.
4. Once in game, allow the messages in the top left corner to finish. There will be a handful of dialogue boxes that pop up, select okay on these. (For the fertility mode box click no.) Once the messages stop, save the game and exit to desktop.
5. Start the game again, load your save and again wait for messages in the top left to finish. Once these have finished, save your game again. Open the MCM and find MCM Recorder, run the included recorder file "AscendedFates1".
6. Once this is finished the game settings should be ready to play, you can adjust if you want, but the game is intended to run on the pre-configured settings.
7. We do recommend checking a few mods in the MCM though, so that you can customize keybinds to your liking; 

*BowRapidCombo*

*Dodge Framework*

*One Click Power Attack*

*Photo Mode*

8. After you check these, play on!
